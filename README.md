🌾 Crop Yield Predictor

This project aims to predict crop yield using machine learning models based on environmental and agricultural features. The work is implemented in a Google Colab notebook, and focuses on evaluating and improving predictive accuracy using different models and techniques.

📌 Overview

-Goal: Develop a predictive system for estimating crop yield using climate and agricultural input variables.
-Platform: Google Colab
-Language: Python
-Key Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `xgboost`, `seaborn`, `smogn`

📁 Files

- `CropYieldPredictor.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook with code, visualizations, and model evaluation.
-`README.md` file including a brief description of the project

🚀 How to Run?
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Install the required packages:
   ```python
   !pip install seaborn
   !pip install smogn
   ```
3. Load your dataset or connect to Google Drive if necessary.
4. Run all cells to train and evaluate the models.
